__label__english I don't know if I have the time.
__label__english Education in this world disappoints me.
__label__english You're in better shape than I am.

__label__english I don't intend to be selfish.
__label__english Let's consider the worst that could happen.
__label__english How many close friends do you have?

__label__english This is always the way it has been.
__label__english I think it is best not to be impolite.
__label__english One can always find time.
__label__english I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't kill myself.
__label__english Back in high school, I got up at 6 a.m. every morning.
__label__english When I woke up, I was sad.
__label__english That is somewhat explained at the end.
__label__english I thought you liked to learn new things.
__label__english Most people write about their daily life.
__label__english If I could send you a marshmallow, Trang, I would.
__label__english In order to do that, you have to take risks.
__label__english Every person who is alone is alone because they are afraid of others.
__label__english Why do you ask?
__label__english I am not an artist. I never had the knack for it.
__label__english I can't tell her now. It's not that simple anymore.
__label__english I am a flawed person, but these are flaws that can easily be fixed.

__label__english You are saying you intentionally hide your good looks?
__label__english I do not have an account in these forums.
__label__english If anyone was to ask what the point of the story is, I really don't know.
__label__english I didn't know where it came from.
__label__english I think my living with you has influenced your way of living.
__label__english This is not important.
__label__english I didn't like it.
__label__english She's asking how that's possible.
__label__english You're just running away from life's problems.
__label__english If you look at the lyrics, they don't really mean much.

__label__english The police will get you to find the bullets.
__label__english Thanks for having explained to me at last why people take me for an idiot.

__label__english If you didn't know me that way then you simply didn't know me.
__label__english It almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day.
__label__english I don't know what you mean.
__label__english My computer has got to be useful for something.
__label__english You wanted to tell me about freedom?
__label__english Uh, now it's really weird...
__label__english If I wanted to scare you, I would tell you what I dreamt about a few weeks ago.

__label__english I need to ask you a silly question.
__label__english I don't know how to demonstrate it, since it's too obvious!
__label__english I wouldn't have thought I would someday look up Viagra in Wikipedia.
__label__english Can it be phrased in another way?
__label__english No one will know.
__label__english I found a solution, but I found it so fast that it can't be the right solution.
__label__english It seems interesting to me.
__label__english Except that here, it's not so simple.
__label__english I like candlelight.
__label__english What did you answer?
__label__english No, he's not my new boyfriend.

__label__english I can only wait.
__label__english It's not much of a surprise, is it?
__label__english I love you.
__label__english I don't like you anymore.
__label__english I am curious.
__label__english Congratulations!
__label__english I don't want to wait that long.
__label__english Why don't you come visit us?
__label__english But the possibility seems unlikely.
__label__english I shouldn't have logged off.
__label__english I don't know what to do anymore.
__label__english It is inevitable that I go to France someday, I just don't know when.
__label__english I hate chemistry.
__label__english I didn't want this to happen.
__label__english You can probably guess what happens though.
__label__english Next thing you know, you'll be in the papers.
__label__english What other options do I have?
__label__english I am not much of a traveller.
__label__english I have nothing better to do.
__label__english I can't explain it either.
__label__english Seriously though, episode 21 made me almost cry while laughing.
__label__english It only shows you're not a robot.
__label__english How could I be a robot? Robots don't dream.
__label__english It's not something anyone can do.
__label__english I don't know if I still have it.
__label__english What do you think I've been doing?
__label__english Don't underestimate my power.
__label__english I don't speak French well enough!
__label__english I was wondering if you were going to show up today.
__label__english Therein lies the problem.
__label__english How do you find food in outer space?
__label__english All you can do is trust one another.
__label__english Everyone wants to meet you. You're famous!
__label__english Why are you sorry for something you haven't done?
__label__english I utterly despise formal writing!
__label__english Foreign people intrigue me.
__label__english Whatever I do, she says I can do better.
__label__english What keeps you up so late?
__label__english You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
__label__english I don't have anyone who'd travel with me.

__label__english I don't speak Japanese.
__label__english This is a pun.
__label__english Nobody understands me.
__label__english I learned to live without her.
__label__english It's useless to keep on thinking any more.
__label__english I have too many things on my mind these days.
__label__english I just wanted to check my email.
__label__english Do you really need to ask the question to know the answer?
__label__english You can't expect me to always think of everything!
__label__english I suppose that behind each thing we have to do, there's something we want to do...
__label__english You really don't have the right priorities!
__label__english Don't expect others to think for you!
__label__english You never have time for important things!
__label__english It's no use pretending to make me believe that I believe things you don't believe!
__label__english It would take me too much time to explain to you why it's not going to work.
__label__english I'm so dumb... I'm trying to explain things to you that I don't understand myself.
__label__english Stop seeing me as a normal person!
__label__english Are you referring to me?
__label__english There will always be things I will never learn, I don't have eternity before me!
__label__english It can't be!
__label__english I wish I could care more about my grades but it seems that, at a certain point of my life, I decided they wouldn't be so important anymore.
__label__english A rolling stone gathers no moss is a proverb.
__label__english Would you like something to drink?

__label__english When will you be back? It all depends on the weather.
__label__english What's the matter? asked the little white rabbit.
__label__english What's going on in the cave? I'm curious. I have no idea.
__label__english We must learn to live together as brothers, or we will perish together as fools.
__label__english Uh... How's that working?
__label__english To tell you the truth, I am scared of heights. You are a coward!
__label__english Trust me, he said.
__label__english This is what I was looking for! he exclaimed.
__label__english This looks pretty interesting, Hiroshi says.
__label__english Their communication may be much more complex than we thought.
__label__english The phone is ringing. I'll get it.
__label__english That's very nice of you, Willie answered.
__label__english Thank you for helping me. Don't mention it.
__label__english Someday I'll run like the wind.
__label__english She likes music. So do I.
__label__english Please don't cry.
__label__english Let me know if there is anything I can do.
__label__english It may be that the happiness awaiting us is not at all the sort of happiness we would want.

__label__english To have doubts about oneself is the first sign of intelligence.
__label__english Poor is not the one who has too little, but the one who wants too much.
__label__english Seeing that you're not surprised, I think you must have known.
__label__english How long does it take to get to the station?
